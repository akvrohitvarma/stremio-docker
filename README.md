## üîí First Boot, System Update, and NordVPN Setup

This section covers basic setup, installing necessary tools, and configuring NordVPN.

### 1. Initial Login and Updates

1.  Click on your new container (**`stremio-service`**) and press **Start**.
2.  Go to the **Console** and wait for the container to boot.
3.  Login with username `root` and the password you set during creation.
4.  Execute the initial system updates:

    ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
    ```

5.  Install `curl`, which is needed to download the NordVPN installer:

    ```bash
    apt install curl -y
    ```

### 2. Install and Configure NordVPN

1.  Install the NordVPN tool:

    ```bash
    sh <(curl -sSf [https://downloads.nordcdn.com/apps/linux/install.sh](https://downloads.nordcdn.com/apps/linux/install.sh))
    ```

    > **Note:** The command provided in the input, `chmod +x install.sh` followed by `bash install.sh`, is often an alternative or older method. The single-line `sh <(...)` command is the official and more streamlined installation method for the NordVPN repository and tool.

2.  **Generate a NordVPN Access Token:**
    * In your web browser, log in to your **NordVPN account**.
    * Navigate to the section to get an access token (usually under the main account settings).
    * Follow the verification steps and **copy the access token**.

3.  Log in to NordVPN in the LXC console using the token:

    ```bash
    nordvpn connect --token <your-token>
    ```

4.  Configure NordVPN settings. Replace `<country name>` with your desired location (e.g., `Zurich`):

    ```bash
    nordvpn set analytics off
    nordvpn set autoconnect enabled <country name>
    nordvpn whitelist add port 80
    nordvpn whitelist add port 443
    nordvpn whitelist add port 8080
    nordvpn whitelist add subnet 0.0.0.0/24
    ```

5.  Check the status. It might show disconnected after the settings change:

    ```bash
    nordvpn status
    ```

6.  **Reboot** the container to apply autoconnect:

    * From the Proxmox GUI, click the **Reboot** button, or
    * Execute the command in the shell: `reboot -f`

7.  After the container successfully reboots, log back in and check the status again. It should show a connection:

    ```bash
    nordvpn status
    ```

    ‚úÖ **VPN is now working and will automatically connect on boot.**

## üê≥ Installing Docker and Docker Compose

You'll need Docker and Docker Compose to easily run the Stremio server.

### 1. Install Docker

Execute the following commands to download and run the official Docker installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com) -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```
### 2. Install Docker Compose

Install Docker Compose v2.22.0 (or the latest stable version) by downloading the binary and making it executable:

```bash
# Download Docker Compose v2.22.0
curl -L "[https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname) -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### 3. Verification

Verify that both Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --help
```

## üíª Setting Up Docker Container to Run Stremio Server

With Docker and NordVPN configured, you can now deploy the Stremio server using a `docker-compose.yml` file. This setup ensures that the Stremio server traffic is routed through the VPN connection established in the LXC container.

### 1. Create the `docker-compose.yml` File

Execute the following command in the container's root directory to create and open the `docker-compose.yml` file using the `nano` text editor:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Paste Configuration

Paste the following content into the nano editor:

```
services:
  stremio:
    image: tsaridas/stremio-docker:latest
    container_name: stremio-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./stremio-data:/root/.stremio-server
    devices:
      - "/dev/dri/renderD128:/dev/dri/renderD128"  # Enable hardware acceleration (if supported by Proxmox/LXC)
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=<your purchased domain>  # **IMPORTANT: CHANGE THIS**
      - NO_CORS=1
      - AUTO_SERVER_URL=1
      - CASTING_DISABLED=1
    networks:
      - stremio-network

networks:
  stremio-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### 3. Customize and Save

* **Crucial Step:** Make sure to replace `<your purchased domain>` with your actual domain name in the `DOMAIN` environment variable.
    * *Optional:* For more details on other environment variables, refer to the image's documentation: `https://hub.docker.com/r/tsaridas/stremio-docker`
* Press **`Ctrl+S`** to save the file.
* Press **`Ctrl+X`** to exit the `nano` editor.

### 4. Deploy the Container

Execute the following command to start the Stremio server container in the background (`-d` for detached mode):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Docker will now pull the tsaridas/stremio-docker:latest image, and then it will successfully set up the stremio-server container.

### 5. Access the Stremio Server

1.  Find the IP address of your LXC container by executing:

    ```bash
    ip a
    ```
    Look for the IP address listed under the **`eth0`** interface.

2.  On any device (laptop, mobile, etc.) on the same local network, open a web browser and navigate to the IP address you found (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`).

You should now see the Stremio server interface running!

> **Note:** Because we used `restart: unless-stopped` in the configuration, the Stremio server container will automatically start whenever the LXC container reboots.

## üåé Setting Up Cloudflare Tunnelling for Remote HTTPS Access

Cloudflare Tunnels (formerly Argo Tunnel) provides a secure, HTTPS-encrypted connection from your LXC container to the Cloudflare network, allowing worldwide access without exposing any ports on your home router.

### 1. Cloudflare Zero Trust Configuration

Follow these steps in your web browser:

1.  Go to the **Cloudflare Dashboard** at `dash.cloudflare.com`.
2.  Navigate to **Zero Trust**.
3.  Click on **Networks**, then click on **Tunnels**.
4.  Click on **Create a new tunnel**.
5.  Select the **Cloudflared** connector option.
6.  **Name your tunnel** (e.g., `stremio-service`) and click **Save**.

### 2. Install and Run `cloudflared` on LXC

1.  On the next screen, follow the on-screen instructions to **Install and run `cloudflared`** on your Debian 64-bit LXC container.
2.  After installing the binary on your LXC, the Cloudflare website will provide a specific command to install the service. **Copy this entire command** (it includes your unique token) and paste it into your LXC terminal:

    ```bash
    # Example command (token will be unique, copy it exactly from the Cloudflare page)
    sudo cloudflared service install <token-provided-by-cloudflare>
    ```
    Click **Next** on the Cloudflare website after executing the command.

### 3. Configure Public Hostname

This step links your custom domain to the internal Stremio service:

1.  In the **Public Hostname** section of the Cloudflare UI, set up the following:
    * **Subdomain (Optional):** Add a subdomain (e.g., `movies`).
    * **Domain:** Select the domain you have purchased and added to Cloudflare (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).
    * **Path:** Leave this empty.
2.  Under **Service** configuration:
    * **Type:** Select **HTTP**.
    * **URL:** Type the internal address of your LXC container running Stremio: `http://<lxc ip>:80` (Replace `<lxc ip>` with the IP address you found earlier using `ip a`).
3.  Click **Save Hostname** and then **Complete setup**.

Now if you go to `movies.<yourdomain>.com`, you will see the Stremio web UI, and you can access this from anywhere in the world to your self-hosted LXC container via HTTPS, secured by Cloudflare.
